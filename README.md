# Calendly Challenge

Weâ€™re excited at the prospect of having you on our team! To help us learn more about you and the way you work, weâ€™ve designed the exercise below. We look forward to seeing what you come up with! 
The Scenarios. 

## The Scenarios
1. Our developer was not exactly focused on quality when he built this simple Tic Tac Toe game. https://codepen.io/jshlfts32/full/bjambP/. Please review this game and complete the following 
    - Write up the bugs and issues that you find with it and publish your results in a GSuite product of your choice. 
        - Please include any information that you think would be relevant to enable a team to fix the mistakes. 
        - Manually write 3-5 automation scripts 
            - Your choice of language/tool...though we are a Ruby shop ðŸ˜‰) 
        - Record a screencast walking through and running your scripts and publish to YouTube.com 
    - Upload your source code as well as links for your manual test results and screencast to your GitHub account and submit the GitHub repo URL as part of your assignment. 

2. Currently, developers write unit and feature (functional) specs. However, the QA team is looking to create an automated regression suite to augment what the developers do and ensure that we maintain the quality and functionality for our users. If you were tasked with leading this initiative, how would you go about approaching the problem? Feel free to answer however you would like but you might consider how we would come up with a prioritized plan and execute on it, what we should work on first, how we get buy-in across the product team, how we would choose the tools and technology, and what hurdles we might need to overcome. There is no hard deadline for your response. However, we would appreciate you giving us your best estimate of when you think you may have this completed.
